# Auto-Machine-Learning-App-with-Python-Streamlit
This project is a machine learning code that uses Python Streamlit, pycaret, pandas and plotly. This simple web app then allows a user to  generate predictions based on his/her uploaded dataset, then also generate a profile report of this dataset and then finally download the built model for his/her use.
